# Chada Tech Simple C++ Clock Program

#Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
In this project we were tasked with creating a program to display a time clock with both 12 hour format & 24 hour format for an international company. 

#What did you do particularly well?
I feel that one thing I did well in this project was creating output formatting for the clock and using modern coding to simplify this task.

#Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I feel with this project there has to be a better way to write a method to ensure times didn't exceed its limit. In my project I feel the constant if statements clutter up the program and I feel there would be a better way to make this part of my project more readable.

#Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
Inline with my previous answer I felt the most challenging part of this project was making the calculation for the 12 hour format. Unlike the 24 hour format making sure that each hour, minute, second didn't surpass its limit. At first I didn't have and idea how to solve for this as my code would act as two 24 hour clocks. After looking through our course reading assignment and writing basic pseudocode I was able to implement a working version of the 12 hours conversion method.

#What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
As my first project written in C++ the skills I obtained from this project was the use of if statements, loops, user inputs, and simple output formatting. 

#How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I tried to make this project very maintainable & readable by adding in depth comments to nearly each function with the code as well as basic functions to encourage adaptability.
